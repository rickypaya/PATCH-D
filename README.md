## ðŸ“± Supabase Database Schema Reminder

### Tables to Create:
- `users` (id, email, username, created_at, avatar_url)
- `collages` (id, theme, created_by, starts_at, expires_at, invite_code)
- `collage_members` (collage_id, user_id, joined_at)
- `photos` (id, collage_id, user_id, storage_path, position_x, position_y, width, height, rotation, uploaded_at)
- `themes` (id, text, category, is_active)

### Storage Buckets:
- `collage-photos` (public read, authenticated write)
- `avatars` (public read, user write own)

## ðŸš€ Success Criteria

By end of Week 2, the app should:
- âœ… Allow users to sign up/sign in
- âœ… Create a collage with random theme and timer
- âœ… Take photo, randomly crop, and upload
- âœ… Display own photos clearly, others' photos blurred
- âœ… Join existing collages via invite code
- âœ… Show all photos unblurred when timer expires
- âœ… Handle multiple active collages per user
- âœ… Work reliably with real-time updates
- âœ… Have polished UI with smooth animations
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully
